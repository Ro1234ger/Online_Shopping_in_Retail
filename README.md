## Description
The RDSDatabaseConnector is a Python class that facilitates the extraction of data from an RDS database, saving it to a local CSV file, and loading it back into a DataFrame for analysis.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to provide a convenient way to interact with an RDS database, allowing users to easily extract and manipulate data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks.

### What I Learned
- How to use SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
- How to use Pandas to extract data from a database into a DataFrame.
- How to save data to a CSV file and load it back into a DataFrame.
